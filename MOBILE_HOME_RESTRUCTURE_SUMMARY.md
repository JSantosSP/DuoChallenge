   - Click to continue playing
   - Empty state: "No tienes juegos activos..."

3. **Game History Section**
   - Shows last 3 completed games
   - Compact card design
   - "Ver todos" link to full history
   - Empty state: "No has completado juegos a√∫n..."

4. **Statistics Card**
   - Always visible at top
   - Shows: Completed, Prizes, Activos

   - Always accessible buttons
   - Join Game & Generate Game
   - No longer hidden behind empty state

6. **More Options**

## üîÑ Data Refresh Strategy

### On Screen Focus
```javascript
useFocusEffect(() => {
  refetchActiveGames();
  refetchStats();
  refetchWonPrizes();
  fetchGameHistory();
});
```

### Pull-to-Refresh
```javascript
await Promise.all([
  refetchActiveGames(), 
  refetchStats(), 
  refetchWonPrizes(),
  fetchGameHistory()
]);
```

All data sources refresh in parallel for optimal performance.

---

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

### Scenarios to Test
1. ‚úÖ **New User** - No games, no prizes, no history (all empty states)
2. ‚úÖ **Active User** - Multiple active games, won prizes, completed history
3. ‚úÖ **Single Game** - One active game with partial progress
4. ‚úÖ **Completed Games** - User with history but no active games
5. ‚úÖ **Data Refresh** - Pull-to-refresh and screen focus updates
6. ‚úÖ **Navigation** - All "Ver todos" and action buttons work

### Expected Behavior
- All sections always visible
- Empty states show helpful messages
- No crashes with null/undefined data
- Smooth scrolling on all sections
- Data updates correctly after actions

---

## üì¶ Dependencies

### Existing Libraries (No New Dependencies)
- `@react-navigation/native` - Navigation
- `@tanstack/react-query` - Data fetching
- `react-native-safe-area-context` - Safe areas
- `expo-secure-store` - Token storage

### Custom Components Used
- `AppButton` - Reusable button
- `LoadingOverlay` - Loading state

---

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

### No Backend Changes Required
All endpoints already exist and are functional.

### Mobile App Changes
- Only `HomeScreen.js` was modified
- No breaking changes to other screens
- No new dependencies added
- Backward compatible with existing navigation

### Rollout Strategy
1. Test the modified HomeScreen thoroughly
2. Verify all empty states render correctly
3. Verify all navigation links work
4. Verify data refresh works on focus and pull
5. Deploy to production
