- Generate Game: `POST /api/game/generate`
- Hooks: `useGame.generateGame()`, navigation to `JoinGameScreen`

**Status:** ✅ Fully Supported

## Additional Endpoints Available (Not Currently Used in Home)

The following endpoints exist but are not used in the Home screen. They may be useful for future enhancements:

### Game Management
- `POST /api/game/reset` - Reset/abandon game
- `GET /api/game/:gameSetId/levels` - Get levels for a game
- `GET /api/game/:gameSetId/progress` - Get detailed progress
- `GET /api/game/level/:levelId` - Get specific level details
- `POST /api/game/level/:levelId/verify` - Verify level answer
- `GET /api/game/prize` - Get prize for completed game

### Prizes Management
- `GET /api/prizes` - Get user's created prizes (not won)
- `POST /api/prizes` - Create new prize
- `PUT /api/prizes/:id` - Update prize
- `DELETE /api/prizes/:id` - Delete prize

### Share/Social
- `POST /api/share/create` - Create share code
- `GET /api/share/codes` - Get user's share codes
- `GET /api/share/verify/:code` - Verify share code
- `GET /api/share/instances` - Get game instances
- `DELETE /api/share/:id` - Deactivate share code

### User Data
- `GET /api/userdata` - Get user's personal data
- `GET /api/userdata/types` - Get available data types
- `POST /api/userdata` - Create user data
- `PUT /api/userdata/:id` - Update user data
- `DELETE /api/userdata/:id` - Delete user data

### Categories & Templates
- `GET /api/categories` - Get categories
- `GET /api/prize-templates` - Get prize templates
- `GET /api/prize-templates/:id` - Get specific template

---

## Data Consistency

### GameSet Object Structure
All game-related endpoints return consistent `GameSet` objects with the following structure:

```typescript
{
  _id: string,
  userId: string,
  shareCode?: string,  // Only for shared games
  levels: string[],    // Array of Level IDs
  completedLevels: string[],
  totalLevels: number,
  progress: number,    // 0-100
  status: 'active' | 'completed' | 'abandoned',
  startedAt: Date,
  completedAt?: Date,
  prizeId?: string
}
```

### Prize Object Structure
Prize-related endpoints return consistent objects:

```typescript
{
  _id: string,
  userId: string,
  title: string,
  description: string,
  imagePath?: string,
  weight: number,      // 1-10
  category: string,
  used: boolean,
  completedAt?: Date,
  usedAt?: Date
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Current Implementation
- All data fetching uses React Query for caching and optimization
- Parallel fetching with `Promise.all` reduces wait time
- Preview limits (3 items) reduce initial render load
- Proper pagination available via navigation to detail screens

### Recommendations
✅ Current implementation is optimal for the feature set.

No additional endpoints or optimizations needed at this time.

---

## Security & Authorization

### Current Status
✅ All endpoints are protected with authentication middleware (`verifyToken`)

The mobile app properly handles:
- JWT token storage using `expo-secure-store`
- Automatic token attachment via Axios interceptors
- Token expiration handling with automatic logout

---

## Conclusion

**No backend changes required.** All necessary API endpoints are implemented and functional. The mobile Home screen restructure can be completed entirely with existing backend infrastructure.

### Verification Checklist
- ✅ Active games endpoint exists
- ✅ Game statistics endpoint exists  
- ✅ Game history endpoint exists with filtering
- ✅ Won prizes endpoint exists
- ✅ Game generation endpoint exists
- ✅ Game joining endpoint exists
- ✅ All data structures are consistent
- ✅ All endpoints are properly authenticated
- ✅ Response formats match expected structures

## Future Considerations (Optional Enhancements)

While not gaps, these could enhance the Home screen experience:

1. **Aggregated Statistics Endpoint**
   - Could add more stats like: total levels completed, average completion time, win rate
   - Current endpoint could be extended without breaking changes

2. **Personalized Recommendations**
   - Could add endpoint to suggest next actions based on user behavior
   - Not critical for current functionality

3. **Real-time Updates**
   - Could add WebSocket support for live game updates
   - Current polling via focus/refresh is sufficient

4. **Batch Endpoint**
   - Could create a single endpoint that returns all Home screen data
   - Current parallel fetching with React Query is already efficient

**Priority:** LOW - Current implementation is fully functional and performant.
